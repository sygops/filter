Now, we're not saying that you're being a menace just by being on the internet, but sometimes it's hard to avoid less-than-stellar language.\r\n\r\nWith #filter, there's no need to second guess yourself because this extension will do it for you. When you install it, #filter will recognize the language you're attempting to use and ask if that's really what you want to do before you post.\r\n\r\n### How To Install:\r\n```\r\nDownload \r\nUnzip\r\nOpen up Google Chrome\r\nGo to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)\r\nCheck off \"Developer Mode\"\r\nClick \"Load Unpacked Extension\"\r\nSelect the entire downloaded folder\r\n```\r\nTa-da, that's it! The extension should be enabled and running.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
