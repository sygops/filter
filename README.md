\#filter
=========
Chrome Extension for the avid Facebook Commenter - built at the 2014 Facebook Waterloo Hackathon 

What is it?
A reminder to think twice about what you post (for your less than kind comments)
Cyberbullying is by far one of the most prominent forms of bullying - something we can't avoid especially if we're consistently on the internet. Now, we're not saying that you're being a menace just by being on the internet, but sometimes it's hard to avoid less-than-stellar language.

With #filter, there's no need to second guess yourself because this extension will do it for you. When you install it, #filter will recognize the language you're attempting to use and ask if that's really what you want to do before you post.
